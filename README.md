# ArCatch

ArCatch is a tool for static-architecture conformance checking of exception handling design, which deals with the **Exception Handling Degradation** problem. ArCatch aims at enforcing exception handling design decisions in Java projects, providing: 
* A declarative DSL for expressing design constraints regarding the exception handling implementation; and 
* A design rule checker to automatically verify the exception handling conformance.
